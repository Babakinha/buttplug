- The original try at building Buttplug in Rust. At the time, tokio
  had just come out, and futures were just becoming a thing. A
  combination of those problems combined with lack of Bluetooth access
  support (which wouldn't even be possible on Windows 10 until April
  2017) meant this version fizzled out pretty quick.
